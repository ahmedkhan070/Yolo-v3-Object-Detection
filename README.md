### Object Detection using YOLOv4 and OpenCV

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv4 architecture implemented with OpenCV's DNN module. The model, trained on the COCO dataset, is used to detect objects in an input image.

**Dependencies**
* OpenCV
* NumPy

**Dataset**
The project uses a sample cat image for demonstration purposes. For practical applications, a larger dataset would be required.

**Model**
* **YOLOv4:** The object detection model used.
* **Weights:** Pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset are loaded.
* **Configuration:** The YOLOv4 configuration file is used to define the network architecture.

**Process**
1. **Import necessary libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy.
2. **Load YOLO model:** Load the YOLOv4 configuration and weights using OpenCV's `dnn.readNetFromDarknet` function.
3. **Image preprocessing:** Load the input image, convert it to a blob, and set it as input to the network.
4. **Inference:** Perform inference on the input image using the loaded YOLO model.
5. **Post-processing:** Process the output to obtain bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.
6. **Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes and labels on the original image.

**Key components**
* **DNN module:** Used to load and run the YOLOv4 model.
* **Blob:** Preprocessed image data in a format suitable for the neural network.
* **NMS:** Non-Maximum Suppression to filter out overlapping bounding boxes.

**Additional Considerations**
* For real-world applications, consider using a larger and more diverse dataset.
* Experiment with different YOLO configurations and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
* Implement techniques for improving detection accuracy, such as data augmentation and transfer learning.
